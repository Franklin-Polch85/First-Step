    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Frank Policicchio and I'm a software developer creating world class websites for everyone.</p>
   <p> My home is located in Orland Park, IL, which is a southwest suburb of Chicago.  I commute to Naperville, IL for my work and it takes me, on average, 45 minutes to get there.</p>
   <h2>About me</h2>
   <p>A constantly evolving field is what has sparked my passion in web development.  This excites me and I'm always looking to learn a new skill or something that can benefit me in my career as a web developer.</p>
    <h3> Hobbies of mine - </h3>
   <p>Outside of web development, weightlifting is another passion of mine and have been dedicated to this activity for 18 years.  Also, I love skiing/snowboarding even though it has been awhile since I've hit the slopes.  Pretty sure I'll back at it soon and looking forward to the day that I can teach my son how to ski.</p>
